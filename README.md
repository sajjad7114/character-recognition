# character-recognition
We try to recognize characters A,B,C,D,E,J,K using Hebb artificial neural network.
First we use binary data and teach each neuron by only its character. The the result shows us that all neurons have "1" output for each input, but the characters own neuron have the highest.
Second we use bipolar data and teach all neurons by all characters. At the result we mostly have "-1" output for all inputs but we can see some "1" outputs for characters own neuran and again the characters own neuron have the highest output.
For the test data we also see the same.
